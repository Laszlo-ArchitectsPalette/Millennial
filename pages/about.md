Laszlo serves as the Design Application Manager for the Chicago studio of [Perkins&Will](https://perkinswill.com/), 
where he oversees all digital-related initiatives. His role involves collaborating 
with teams to develop innovative digital strategies and researching new 
applications and technologies to enhance workflows and craft. Before 
assuming this position, Laszlo worked as an architect in Los Angeles, Dallas, 
and now Chicago, specializing in early-phase design and analysis of 
hospitality and healthcare projects. 
 
Laszlo’s design philosophy is founded on the belief that architecture shapes 
the backdrop of daily life, with the power to enhance experiences and 
uplift communities. He measures success not just by project completion but 
through the small victories and collaborative achievements along the way. An 
enduring piece of advice that guides him is the importance of listening—truly 
listening—to others, as it provides invaluable perspectives and insights.
