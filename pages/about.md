Hello! I’m Laszlo Andrasi aka Laz—Architect, Artist, and Tech Enthusiast. I work as the 
Design Application Manager for the Chicago studio of [Perkins&Will](https://perkinswill.com/), 
overseeing all digital-related initiatives. My role involves collaborating 
with teams to develop innovative digital strategies and researching new 
applications and technologies to enhance workflows and craft. Before 
assuming this position, I worked as an architect in Los Angeles, Dallas, 
and now Chicago, specializing in early-phase design and analysis of 
hospitality and healthcare projects. 
 
My design philosophy is founded on the belief that architecture shapes 
the backdrop of daily life, with the power to enhance experiences and 
uplift communities. Success is measured not just by project completion but 
through the small victories and collaborative achievements along the way. An 
enduring piece of advice that guides him is the importance of listening—truly 
listening—to others, as it provides invaluable perspectives and insights.


This page is my way of sharing the evolving intersections of architecture, technology, and art.
