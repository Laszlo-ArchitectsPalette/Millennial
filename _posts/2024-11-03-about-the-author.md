Hello! I’m Laszlo Andrasi aka Laz—Architect, Artist, and Tech Enthusiast. Working in Chicago’s fast-paced architecture scene by day, bringing homes to life with watercolor and sketch by night.

This page is my way of sharing the evolving intersections of architecture, technology, and art. Here, you’ll find insights on architecture trends, innovative advancements in AEC, and glimpses into my creative journey. Check out [my portfolio ](https://issuu.com/andrasi_design/docs/architects_palette_portfolio_summer24/) for my latest featured work along with how to request a commission.
