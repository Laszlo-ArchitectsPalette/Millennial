# Ecosystem Archival – Phil Freelon Submission 2024  

The **Phil Freelon competition**, a cherished Perkins&Will tradition, has inspired innovative thinking for over two decades. This year’s challenge invited teams to anticipate socio-cultural changes and reimagine the transformation of civic spaces, with the San Francisco Public Library serving as a focal point.  

Collaborating with my talented colleagues—[Jason Pieper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-pieper-7804a8108/), [Natalie Salk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-salk-22618295/), and [Nico Hsu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-hsu-00000001/)—we explored cutting-edge technologies and embraced the concept of **design by subtraction** to craft a forward-thinking proposal. By leveraging tools like **Speckle** and **Forma**, we optimized collaboration and redefined early-phase design workflows.  

Our project, **Ecosystem Archival**, envisions the San Francisco Public Library in 2049 as a dynamic hub for ecological restoration and global cooperation. The library is transformed into a planetary archive, preserving biodiversity through seed banks, research facilities, and interactive spaces that connect global ecological initiatives. Sustainability lies at the heart of the design, incorporating carbon sequestration, advanced water management systems, and renewable energy solutions.  

The competition journey was marked by intensive brainstorming and workflow experimentation, culminating in an innovative vision that prioritizes community engagement and ecological awareness.
