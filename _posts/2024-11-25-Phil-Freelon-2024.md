# Ecosystem Archival - Phil Freelon Submission 2024


The "Ecosystem Archival" project reimagines the San Francisco Public Library in 2049 as a hub for ecological restoration and global collaboration. This vision includes a planetary archive preserving ecosystems, research labs, seed banks, and interactive spaces connecting global initiatives. The library integrates sustainability through carbon sequestration, water management, and renewable energy. The design process for the Perkins&Will Phil Freelon Competition involved intensive brainstorming, testing workflows like Speckle, and finalizing innovative concepts. The project emphasizes community engagement and global ecological awareness.
