# Hello world!
*Hey look I did a thing!*

Laz here, welcome to Architect's Palette! I started this site after attending AEC TECH 2024 hosted by the New York office of [Thornton Tomasetti](https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/), and being inspired to start writing a blog on my experiences and thoughts in Architecture, Art and Technology. My buddy Mario gave me a few options for how to host my own blog, and using github and coding the entire thing was the only free option. Luckily for my adolescence years building MySpace profiles for friends, along withh this awesome template, the site is up and running *ish*! I look forward to posting regular content here, mostly as a mental dump, but also in the hopes that you all find it interesting! If you'd like to learn more about me see the about section of the site, link above and below.
