# AEC TECH 2024

I was fortunate to attend my first AEC Tech Symposium this year. The AEC Tech is an annual event focused on technology advancements in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries. Organized by the nonprofit Thornton Tomasetti CORE studio, it brings together professionals, technologists, and academics interested in digital innovation within AEC. The symposium includes workshops, presentations, and networking opportunities centered on computational design, building information modeling (BIM), digital fabrication, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies in the field. 

The week long event is composed of both virtual and in-person workshops, tech crawls and tours, a symposium, and ending on a 26 hour hackathon over the weekend. The event is designed to encourage knowledge exchange, showcase emerging tools and workflows, and foster collaboration among industry experts and technology enthusiasts. Each year’s symposium has a different theme that highlights current trends and challenges, offering both practical and theoretical insights on the evolving role of technology in AEC.

Thank you again to the Bill Berger and the Chicago Studio, as well as Nick Cameron and the entire Digital Practice team for the opportunity to attend AEC Tech this year. I learned a lot and am looking forward to bringing back some of the innovative tools and energy back to Perkins&Will.

# Workshops

I started off the AEC Tech experience with an all day workshop with CORE Studio called, Transforming Text: Practical NLP for the AEC Industry. Funny enough was the fact that half of the Perkins&Will attendees, 7 total, also had the same idea. 

The session was hosted by Seyedomid (Omid) Sajedi, Senior AI & ML Engineer at Core Studio. The **CORE studio's Transforming Text: Practical NLP for the AEC Industry** workshop is a hands-on, half-day session designed for AEC professionals looking to streamline document review processes using natural language processing (NLP) tools. Given the time-intensive nature of document analysis in AEC, this workshop introduces practical NLP techniques to improve productivity and automate text-heavy tasks.

The workshop started with setting up a Python environment on either a local machine or Google Colab. We then started with an initial exercise learning basic NLP techniques, starting with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). This NLP library excels in tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. The first part covered various machine learning and non-machine-learning techniques for automating document processing, giving us practical tools that could simplify some of the more text-heavy tasks in our work.

In the Deep Learning and Transformers section, we explored advanced NLP concepts, beginning with the fundamentals like tokenization and text embeddings. We also learned how to use unsupervised learning methods—such as topic modeling with small language models—to uncover insights from large document collections. One highlight was building an AI-powered semantic search tool using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and we even experimented with NLP agents to boost the reasoning abilities of language models. The workshop was beginner-friendly but required some basics, like a laptop, internet connection, and Google account for exercises on Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab. For the final exercise, we needed minimal paid API access.

Hackathons provide a unique opportunity to join a team of complete strangers and dive into a problem. This being my first hackathon experience, I was impressed with how quickly teams reached a flow state and solved complex problems. I look forward to applying this learning experience in future collaborative efforts.
