## Hackathon

Hackathons provide a unique opportunity to join a team of complete strangers and dive into a problem. This being my first hackathon experience, I was impressed with how quickly teams reached a flow state and solved complex problems. I look forward to applying this learning experience in future collaborative efforts.
