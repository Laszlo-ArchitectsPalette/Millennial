# AEC TECH 2024

I was fortunate to attend my first AEC Tech Symposium this year. The AEC Tech Symposium is an annual event focused on technology advancements in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries. Organized by the nonprofit Thornton Tomasetti CORE studio, it brings together professionals, technologists, and academics interested in digital innovation within AEC. The symposium includes workshops, presentations, and networking opportunities centered on computational design, building information modeling (BIM), digital fabrication, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies in the field. 

The week long event is composed of both virtual and in-person workshops, tech crawls and tours, a symposium, and ending on a 26 hour hackathon over the weekend. The event is designed to encourage knowledge exchange, showcase emerging tools and workflows, and foster collaboration among industry experts and technology enthusiasts. Each yearâ€™s symposium has a different theme that highlights current trends and challenges, offering both practical and theoretical insights on the evolving role of technology in AEC.

Thank you again to the Bill Berger and the Chicago Studio, as well as Nick Cameron and the entire Digital Practice team for the opportunity to attend AEC Tech this year. I learned a lot and am looking forward to bringing back some of the innovative tools and energy back to Perkins&Will.

**Overview:**  
The **CORE studio's Transforming Text: Practical NLP for the AEC Industry** workshop is a hands-on, half-day session designed for AEC professionals looking to streamline document review processes using natural language processing (NLP) tools. Given the time-intensive nature of document analysis in AEC, this workshop introduces practical NLP techniques to improve productivity and automate text-heavy tasks.

## Workshop Structure:

### 1. Classical ML and NLP Techniques
   - **Setup and Essentials**: Attendees will start by setting up a Python environment, learning to use a local machine or Google Colab to perform NLP tasks.
   - **Techniques and Methods**: This section covers simple machine learning and non-ML methods to automate document processing.

### 2. Deep Learning and Transformers
   - **Fundamentals**: A deep dive into core NLP concepts such as tokenization and text embeddings.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Focuses on topic modeling with small language models to gain insights from large document sets.
   - **Semantic Search**: Attendees will learn to build a small AI-powered search module using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
   - **Agents**: This segment enhances the reasoning capabilities of language models and covers tool use instructions for NLP agents.

## Level and Requirements
Geared towards beginner to intermediate users, participants will complete exercises on Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab. Requirements include:

Hackathons provide a unique opportunity to join a team of complete strangers and dive into a problem. This being my first hackathon experience, I was impressed with how quickly teams reached a flow state and solved complex problems. I look forward to applying this learning experience in future collaborative efforts.
